create the basic socket io netowrk

use peerjs to create a uniqe id to each client

use uuid v4 to create rooms with uniqe id

to handle it with express we will prob have to redirect to something like that:
NormalUrl/multiplayer/uuidV4

for the other user joining we can prompt a name request and than redirect to the same page
with the extra search param. we will also add him in the second entry to users database with 
the uniqe peerjs id and his name. param add example:

var url = new URL("http://foo.bar/?x=1&y=2");
// If your expected result is "http://foo.bar/?x=1&y=2&x=42"
url.searchParams.append('x', 42);

than we will start laying the surface to our chat and game, set certain emits
and respond properly. emit message for chat and game for a move.
